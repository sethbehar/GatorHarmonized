Welcome to "GatorHarmonized"! 

GatorHarmonized is a C++ project that uses a graph, Dijkstra's algorithm, and Bredth-First Search to match three similar artists to a user-inputted artist. 

This project is designed to help music enthusiasts discover new artists that are similar to their favorite ones.

GatorHarmonized works by taking an input artist name from the user and building a graph of related artists based on their similarity to the input artist. The graph is then used to run Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS to find the three most similar artists to the input artist.. 

To create this project, we utilized a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to represent the frontend of our program. This makes it easy for users to input their favorite artist and view the results in a user-friendly way.

Additionally, we used a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file with over 10,000 unique artists. This allowed us to create an adjacency matrix with over 100,000,000 nodes, representing the connections between each artist and their similarity scores. This large dataset required significant computational power and memory to process, which we were able to achieve through optimized algorithms and efficient data structures.

Overall, GatorHarmonized is a powerful tool for discovering new music and expanding one's musical horizons. With its advanced algorithms and extensive dataset, it provides users with a personalized and unique music discovery experience.
