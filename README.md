"GatorHarmonized" 

GatorHarmonized is a C++ project that uses a graph and Dijkstra's algorithm and (insert algorithm) to match three similar artists to a user-inputted artist. 
This project is designed to help music enthusiasts discover new artists that are similar to their favorite ones.

GatorHarmonized works by taking an input artist name from the user and building a graph of related artists based on their similarity to the input artist. The graph is then used to run Dijkstra's algorithm and (insert algorithm) to find the three most similar artists to the input artist.
